# The-Flamethrowing-Doggo

#The Flamethrowing Doggo is a simple linear 8-bit pixel game designed out of curiosity for game mechanism. I have never scripted game codes prior and figured that I should scale down my ventures before trying out environment building with Unreal engine and Unity. This experience has made me realise that I have in fact much more to learn and discover, yet I crave for more knowledge Python has to offer.

#To the start of many endeavors, Seth.
